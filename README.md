# Tank Game for SSD Lab project

Simple tank game

## Requirements to build and run
- JDK for Java 17. Older versions may work, but we didn't test it.
- Folder `img`, `maps`, `config` containing files.
- In `config` file, it must contain `game-control.properties`.

As the game is simple, adding maps is not supported. Config file 
should not be modified by hand.

## Main class

The main class is in `src/gui/Window.java`. You can use your IDE or 
text editor to run it.

Note: The file must be run from the directory of the project or it won't work.
